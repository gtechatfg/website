                <p>Exercism is an online community to help students to practice their
                    skills by completing multiple exercises.</p>
                <p>Exercism offers tracks for a wide variety of languages such as
                    Python, C, C++, etc. Each track has a set of core
                    exercises and a large set of additional exercises. Exercises are
                    classified
                    on the basis of difficulty as well as learning goals.
                </p>

                <p>Each exercise comes with Instructions on the exercise. You can code
                    your solution on your machine, and upload the soluion. Before uploading a solution,
