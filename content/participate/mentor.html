                <p>Mentors are the backbone of our Platform. Mentors create learning
                    paths, help Enablers and Students to understand topics, and collate
                    and curate Digital Content.
                </p>
                <p>Mentors also lead many initiatives within ATFG such as moderation,
                    UI/UX design, bot development, etc</p>
